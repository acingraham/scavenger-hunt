# scavenger-hunt
A scavenger hunt composed of programming puzzles

## Some initial puzzle ideas.  These are primarily notes to myself.
- Username & password hidden in HTML
- Encryption / Decryption algorithms
- Use physical lock for final puzzle
- Implement an equation that is used to generate the lock password.  Give some sample input and output for the equation.
- Enter in a word that is exactly the right length
- Hidden elements on the page
- Figure out the person's favorite color.  Enter the hex value of it.
- Crossword puzzle
- Regex
- Align divs using CSS, or have something that will print out the answer once they correct the code
- Regex crossword
- Quiz
- Write AI code to defeat something
- Beat an unbeatable game by changing the code
- Help your friend win a band competition.  This is from hackthissite.org.
- Have a sea of elements.  Then, the appropriate selectors that select those elements will spell out instructions.
  - Selector for a tag
  - Selector for a class
  - Selector for an id
  - Selector for elements with multiple classes
  - Selector for element with an id and class
  - Selector for element that is a child of another element
  - Then the puzzle will be "Username is \<selector for ...\>, Password id \<selector for ...\>"
- Function that reveals one letter every 10 seconds.  They should alter it to make it faster
- Code is broken and needs to be fixed to work
- Write code that will light up every third light
- Add an API that will return one number slightly more often than others.  They'll have to write a program to hit that API and do some analysis to figure out which number it is.
